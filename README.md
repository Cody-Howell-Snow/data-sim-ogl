# Data Simulator
This project was used to fill in the a database project that simulates an Online Gaming Service, subscribing and gettings access to many games. There are some parameters in the default that I intend to open up to the public to generate their own dataset, including a few more data-export options. 
You can find a demo (and current production build) at (this link)[https://codydhowell.com/sims/olg/].
